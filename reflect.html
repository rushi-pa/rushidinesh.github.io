        <b style="color: black;">Explain the concept of Responsive Design.  What does the term mean?  What did you discover in your research?<br/>
        ANS 1</b> - Due to the growth of technology and mobile phones the webiste has to change. The website visible on the computer may not look the same as the website on the mobile screen. Take seneca blackboard for an example, the seneca's blackboard on the computer is fully shown including all the tools and the news on just one page while the seneca's same website when opened on mobile shows totally opposite senario where the news can be found on the lower side of the section while tools on the top
         of the web Page. 
         During the reserach I have discovered that the page should be sized accroding to the display size and it should be automatic as my website is my website is sized according to mobile horizontal as well as virtical.</p><br/><br/>

         <p><b style="color: black;">How does responsive design relate to web technologies?  How can web pages take advantage of it? <br/>ANS 2</b>  Responsive Web design means that the design and development of the website should be able to respond to the user's behaviour and enviornment based on screen size and platform. In other words the website should have technology to automatically respond to the user's preferences. 
        Web pages require to have such changes so that the user can read the text and view the website accordingly. </p> <br/><br/>

        <p><b style="color: black;">What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive design?<br/>ANS 3</b> To make the web page mobile friendly I have used the bootstrap but didn't help much so I have decided to make the html using the meta character and 
        change css so that the website can become more mobile friendly. </p> <br/><br/>

        <p><b style="color: black;">What did you learn about building web apps for different devices?<br/>ANS 4</b> I have learned that the website hosting is wasier if it responsive to all browser all size and all platform. If the website is not user friendly then it will annoy 
            the user and may result into huge loss to the company. </p>
